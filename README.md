# Age_-_Gender_Detection

Due to Covid, the entire world scenario has changed. The world has turned digital now. Considering the prevention of spread of Covid-19 and the future pandemic diseases which are unknown to us at the point, going Digital is one of the safest option. Our system aims to detect the age and gender of an individual via real-time camera feed and give access to the users accordingly.

In our project we show that by learning representations through the use of deep-convolutional neural networks (CNN), a significant increase in performance can be obtained on these tasks. To this end, we propose a simple convolutional net architecture that can be used even when the amount of learning data is limited.

This project proposes an automatic age and gender recognition system based on a human face by using a convolution neural network, OpenCV and Python. In recent years extracting information from the human face is one of the active research topics. The Human face consists of facial features like eyes, ears, nose, chin, etc. which can be analyzed as per our requirements. Age and gender recognition start primarily with face detection.

To demonstrate the working of our project, we have created a Marriage Match-Making Web-App. This web-app is a registration portal which consists of the following:
 
1. A singup page which will collect user information such as name, location, zodiac sign, interests.

2. After submitting these details, the user is redirected to a page where his/her age and gender will be detected using real time detection via their webcam. The user    must give permission of their webcam in order to capture their face.

3. After this, the user will be directed to a page where their credentials will be displayed along with thier photo captured during the detection portal.
